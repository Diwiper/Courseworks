# Sorting Algorithms: Performance Analysis

This project is a coursework in the discipline "Data Structures and Algorithms", dedicated to the study of the efficiency of various sorting algorithms.

## Goal
Compare the performance of classical sorting algorithms based on experiments.

## Implemented algorithms:
- Hybrid algorithm "insertion â€“ exchange"
- Insertion Sort in two ways

## Functionality
- Generation of random arrays
- Measurement of execution time for each algorithm
- Construction of comparison graphs or tables


## Conclusion
As a result of the study, algorithms that work best on different data volumes were identified.

# Reduced assembly language translator

This project is a coursework in the discipline "System Programming" aimed at implementing a translator for a simplified version of assembly language.

## Goal
To create a console translator that converts abbreviated ASM code into machine code by creating an lst file.
## Features:
- Support for instructions: Cli, Push, Bt, Lea, Out, Cmp, Jnz, Jmp
- Handling variables and labels
- Handling syntax errors

## Functionality and description
- Translator language: C++
- Generating a token table, a sentence structure table, a one-pass and two-pass listing file

## Conclusion
The project is needed to understand the principles of translators and the internal structure of machine code.
